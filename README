PawHash
=======

PawHash is a Chrome/Chromium extension which securely generates website-specific
passwords from a single master password. It's based on the excellent Password
Hasher extension for Firefox by Steve Cooper <http://wijjo.com/passhash> and
generates the same passwords given the same inputs.

Why use it?
-----------

Using the same password on many websites is a security risk, because many sites
do not store the password securely or are vulnerable to exploits allowing the
passwords to be intercepted. When one site is compromised and the passwords
stolen and cracked, this often allows the attacker to use the same
username/email and password to log in as those users on many different sites.

However, remembering a unique password for every website is impractical. This
extension solves the problem by allowing you to remember just one master
password, which is used to calculate a unique and secure password for a given
site. This works by using a "hash algorithm" which, given the master password
and the name of the website, combines them in a way which is impossible to
reverse, but generates the same result every time.

This avoids having to use a password manager which stores all your passwords,
meaning there is nothing for an attacker to steal, and you can use any computer
you trust without needing to have a copy of your password file.
